                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Jonas I'm 25 years old and this is my 
                    Portfolio project for CodeCademy. So a little bit about me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the time when I'm doing this project I'm in Germany playing
                    basketball professionally. So yes, I play it professionally from 5x5 to 3x3.
                    Travelling around the world with basketball and living quite a nice life, but
                    I also like programming, thats why I'm learning and hope to find a job, so I could
                    enjoy normal life!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also enjoy gaming and hanging out with friends and meeting new people.
                    Learning new cultures, new languages. For example at the moment I'm trying to learn
                    Swedish language, but also now it's my second year in Germany so I can understand quite a lot
                    and speak it some what.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the same time I enjoy listening to music, like a lot. It helps me to get in to mood
                    prepare for work, practices, workouts. This journey of coding is fun, because I like it, but
                    also it's something I studied and just putted a side and forgot about it, which I don't like, because now
                    I have to relearn everything again from basic stuff.
                </p>

            <p>

                Know quite a lot about electricity market about independent providers, since I worked in two major electricity providers in Lihuania(Igntis and Electrum). One of those
                we're Lithuanian company and the other was Latvian company.
                Also have worked in construction for building new warehouses, offices and bulding, with metal panels filled with special thermo foam. So I would say I have experience in different branches
                of work enviroment. Worked in IT company called ,,Hostinger" whoch provides web hosting for the websties, so the websites could be accesible 24/7. Last but not least, I have worked at a
